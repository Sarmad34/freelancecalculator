    <h1>About Freelance Calculator</h1>
    <p className="lead">Helping independent professionals build sustainable, profitable businesses since 2024.</p>
    <p>Freelance Calculator was founded with a single mission: to provide the most accurate, transparent, and easy-to-use pricing tools for freelancers globally. We believe that when freelancers have better data, they make better decisions and earn what they are truly worth.</p>
    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Many freelancers fail not because of their lack of skill, but because of poor financial planning. We aim to remove the mystery from business math by factoring in often-overlooked costs like billable utilization, tax reserves, and platform fees.</p>
    <h2>Built for Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not track your specific financial inputs. Our app runs almost entirely in your browser, ensuring that your business strategy remains your business.</p>
