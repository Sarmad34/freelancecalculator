    <h1>About Freelance Calculator</h1>
    <p className="lead">Helping independent professionals build sustainable, profitable businesses through transparent financial tools.</p>
    <p>Freelance Calculator was founded in 2024 with a simple mission: to bridge the gap between "working for yourself" and "running a business." Many freelancers fail not because of their skills, but because of poor financial planning.</p>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>After years of navigating the complex world of self-employment—from tracking billable utilization to managing quarterly taxes—we realized that most online tools were either too simple or too opaque. We built this platform to provide high-trust, production-quality calculators that show you the "why" behind every number.</p>
    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>We leverage modern technologies like Google Gemini AI to provide intelligent project quoting and React for a lightning-fast user experience. Most importantly, we prioritize privacy: your financial data never leaves your browser.</p>
