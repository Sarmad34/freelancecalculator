    <p>Last updated: June 2024</p>
    <p>At Freelance Calculator, our mission is to provide freelancers with accurate, reliable, and actionable financial information. To maintain the trust of our community, we follow a strict editorial policy.</p>
    
    <h2>Accuracy and Verification</h2>
    <p>All financial formulas and calculators on this site are reviewed for mathematical accuracy based on current business standards. While we provide estimates, we strive to ensure the logic reflects real-world freelance economics, including overhead, utilization, and tax requirements.</p>

    <h2>Independence and Transparency</h2>
    <p>Our tools are designed to be objective. We do not prioritize specific platforms (like Upwork or Fiverr) over others unless clearly stated in a comparison or tool intended for that specific platform.</p>

    <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Some features, such as our Project Quote Builder, utilize Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini). We clearly label these features. The output of AI is meant as a starting point and should always be reviewed by the user for professional accuracy.</p>

    <h2>Updating Content</h2>
    <p>The freelance market changes rapidly. We review our calculators and guides annually to ensure they reflect current tax trends and platform fee structures.</p>
